Hi Michael,

I hope you’re doing well! My name is Hoda, and I’m currently in the application process for the backend I role at Instabug.

I’m very excited about the opportunity and would love to get some insights from someone who’s already part of the team. If you have a few minutes, I’d greatly appreciate any tips or advice you could share about the role or the company culture.

Thank you so much for your time and assistance!
