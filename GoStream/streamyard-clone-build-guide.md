# Getting Started with BuildStream

## 1. Set Up Development Environment

1. Install necessary tools:
   - Go (latest stable version)
   - Node.js and npm (for React)
   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - Git

2. Set up your IDE (e.g., VS Code, GoLand) with appropriate plugins for Go and React development.

## 2. Project Structure

Create a main project directory and set up the following structure:

```
buildstream/
├── frontend/
├── backend/
│   ├── user-service/
│   ├── studio-service/
│   ├── streaming-service/
│   ├── chat-service/
│   ├── analytics-service/
│   ├── notification-service/
│   └── api-gateway/
├── docker/
└── docs/
```

## 3. Backend Development

Start with developing the core microservices:

1. User Service:
   - Set up a basic Go project structure
   - Implement user registration and authentication endpoints
   - Set up MySQL connection and user data models
   - Implement JWT token generation and validation

2. Studio Service:
   - Create endpoints for studio CRUD operations
   - Set up MySQL for storing studio data
   - Integrate Elasticsearch for studio search functionality

3. API Gateway:
   - Set up a reverse proxy using a Go framework like Echo or Gin
   - Implement routing logic to direct requests to appropriate microservices

For each service:
- Use Go modules for dependency management
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Write unit tests for core functionality

## 4. Message Broker and Caching

1. Set up RabbitMQ:
   - Create a Docker container for RabbitMQ
   - Implement message producers and consumers in relevant services

2. Set up Redis:
   - Create a Docker container for Redis
   - Implement caching in services where appropriate (e.g., Chat Service)

## 5. Frontend Development

1. Set up a new React project using Create React App or Next.js
2. Create basic components for:
   - User authentication
   - Studio management
   - Streaming interface

3. Set up state management (e.g., Redux, Context API)
4. Implement API calls to backend services

## 6. Docker and Containerization

1. Create Dockerfiles for each microservice and the frontend
2. Create a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate all services
3. Set up development and production configurations

## 7. Implement Core Streaming Functionality

1. Research and choose a WebRTC library for Go
2. Implement basic video streaming in the Streaming Service
3. Create a simple streaming interface in the React frontend

## 8. Continuous Integration

1. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
2. Configure automated testing and building for both frontend and backend

## 9. Documentation

1. Set up Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation
2. Write README files for each service and the main project

## 10. Iterative Development

Continue building out features in order of priority:
1. Enhance streaming capabilities
2. Implement chat functionality
3. Add multi-platform streaming support
4. Develop analytics and reporting features

## Next Steps

1. Start with the User Service and API Gateway
2. Move on to the Studio Service and frontend components for studio management
3. Tackle the Streaming Service and implement basic video functionality
4. Continue with other services based on your priority list

Remember to commit your code regularly and push to a version control system like GitHub or GitLab. This will help you track your progress and make it easier to collaborate or showcase your work.
